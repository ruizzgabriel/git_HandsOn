# This code is a Python script that classifies a given sequence as DNA or RNA. It uses the argparse module to parse command line arguments, allowing the user to provide the sequence and an optional motif.

The code first creates an argument parser object and adds two arguments to it: the sequence (--seq or -s) and the motif (--motif or -m). If no arguments are provided, the help message is printed and the script exits.

The sequence is then converted to upper case, and the script checks if it is a DNA or RNA sequence using a regular expression (re.search('^[ACGTU]+$', args.seq)). If the sequence is DNA, the script prints "The sequence is DNA", if it's RNA, it prints "The sequence is RNA". If it's neither, the script prints "The sequence can be DNA or RNA". If the sequence is not a DNA or RNA sequence, the script prints "The sequence is not DNA nor RNA".

If a motif is provided, the script converts it to upper case, and performs a search for the motif in the sequence using a regular expression (re.search(args.motif, args.seq)). If the motif is found, the script prints "It is found". If the motif is not found, the script prints "It is not found".
